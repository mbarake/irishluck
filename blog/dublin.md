## Dublin

I have mixed emotion towards Dublin. The polluted river that divides the city is polluted. 
I wonder why rivers are not left to flow in peace. Instead like a clogged
 artery this river is being choked by the immense water business between banks. 
As the industrial city grows into its industrial past I wonder how there will be 
a way for more vibrant arts, culture and economy to come together.  The city has something 
interesting going for it but how much is down to  the 
development that  has taken place? It is important to look at the city on a
historical, macro level. The lack of history in Dublin has probably always
 been one of the biggest issues with the city.
