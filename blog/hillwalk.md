## Hill Walk

The famous hill walk from Bray to Greystones is really inspiring. 
You notice people are happy and energetic with a positive outlook on life. 
They become part of the scenery. There's still that smile on everyone's faces as they say their 
goodbyes and everyone is moving on as friends, we could see it!  The hill walk gives a sense of being a part of the
 community. 
It's like the people walking become your friends and family and are always there for you!

Hiking exposes you to new experiences and as a result it will affect your energy which has the potential to be
 transformed and channeled onto your kids into 
something really beautiful and mesmerising. That night  it was my beloved children who looked into my soul, 
with those big, black, expressive eyes, and said we like to be out there with you next time.
