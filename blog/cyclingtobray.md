## Cycling to Bray 

I was in doubt about electrical bicycles but decided to rent one anyway. 
I decided to cycle to Bray. the experience was amazing. I felt like a little kid blown 
by the wind running without effort or as if I am holding a kite and the wind is pushing me away.
I have ridden on trains before and in a bus, but on a bike it is completely different experience.
It is easy to enjoy the scenery and the environment surrounding the five senses. It is simply the optimal experience.

Bray is a nice little town by the beach. I guess any town by the beach has a character to it, 
and the right people tend to gravitate towards that.
The sound of the waves crushing have a noise cancelling effect. The negative noise you have been 
hearing from toxic relationships was really picking at my eardrums. 
Eventually a waft of warmth started to emanate from within and when 
I turned around the sun had finally emerged.
