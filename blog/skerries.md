## Skerries

Gravity locks you in two dimensional world and that is why jumping 
is so liberating and joyful. It simply let your soul escape for seconds. 
Kite surfing is the escape from gravity into the universe of GOD, it's essentially natural forces
 which carry you into a genuinely life changing experience.

In Skerries you see people floating between their spiritual past and the
the ills of modern life. It is one of the most beautiful and best preserved places in Ireland
where you feel that time stood still. Here you will find seascapes of rocks and small islands, 
coffee shops that smell like burned honey dripping from the tree of eternity. 

The playground overseas the majestic sea, where the laughter of children pierce the
blowing wind and reach the ears of the deaf.
