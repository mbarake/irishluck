## Blessington

As I reached Tulfarris holiday village, I heard the songs of the birds mixed with the bleat of the 
lambs and the splash of the fowls on the lakes. Birds such as keer-raths, partridges, and coots 
came singing from the nearby grazing of the miles of hills and valleys, so charming were they, 
with their grandsires, their grandsires' children. 
They called out to me, calling for songs of birds; and on greeting me, they said to me, 
long may you come, traveller; 
and perhaps you may catch your thousand blessings here, among these blessed ones.

There was only one bus that goes in the morning to city centre, but that did not pose any 
problem as in such an environment it is a joy to wake in the very morning and walk through 
the dark mist while the sun ray find their way in a bezier curvy way.

The house had not TV screen so one day I went for a night walk and watched the stars and 
then saw a man jogging bare foot in his hometown. I think that is amazing. 
If we were brought into this new world that we believe in, how would that affect us. 
That night I realised that there is no truth in television. For the future of mankind, 
one must try to be active and not just a spectator.  One must know that he can be the change.
